## Packages Needed
To run the Flask application for the Flames game, you'll need to install the following packages:

- Flask: A web framework for Python that simplifies the process of building web applications.

Install Flask: If Flask is not installed, you can install it using the pip package manager. In the terminal or command prompt, run the following command:

```
pip install flask
```
Virtual Environment (Optional): Consider using a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies. This way, you can have different versions of Flask or other packages for different projects. To create a virtual environment, run the following command:

```
python -m venv myenv
```

Ensure that you have Python and pip (Python package installer) installed on your system before executing the above command.
